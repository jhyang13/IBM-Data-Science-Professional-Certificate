### There are 6 modules in this course
Get ready to dive into the world of Machine Learning (ML) by using Python! This course is for you whether you want to advance your Data Science career or get started in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

This course will begin with a gentle introduction to Machine Learning and what it is, with topics like supervised vs unsupervised learning, linear & non-linear regression, simple regression and more.  

You will then dive into classification techniques using different classification algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and Logistic Regression. You’ll also learn about the importance and different types of clustering such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. 

With all the many concepts you will learn, a big emphasis will be placed on hands-on learning. You will work with Python libraries like SciPy and scikit-learn and apply your knowledge through labs. In the final project you will demonstrate your skills by building, evaluating and comparing several Machine Learning models using different algorithms.  

By the end of this course, you will have job ready skills to add to your resume and a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency.

**Link:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone?specialization=ibm-data-science

### What you'll learn

- Demonstrate proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques using a real-world data set and prepare a report for stakeholders   
- Apply your skills to perform data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization model development, and model evaluation
- Write Python code to create machine learning models including support vector machines, decision tree classifiers, and k-nearest neighbors  
- Evaluate the results of machine learning models for predictive analysis, compare their strengths and weaknesses and identify the optimal model   

### Skills you'll gain
- Github
- Jupyter Notebook
- K-Means Clustering
- Methodology
- Data Science Methodology

### There are 5 modules in this course
This is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. This capstone project course will give you the chance to practice the work that data scientists do in real life when working with datasets. 

In this course you will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting your results to stakeholders. 

You will be tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. With the help of your Data Science findings and models, the competing startup you have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

In this course, there will not be much new learning, instead you’ll focus on hands-on work to demonstrate and apply what you have learnt in previous courses.  By successfully completing this Capstone you will have added a project to your data science and machine learning portfolio to showcase to employers.
